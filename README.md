## Introduction

This Streamlit app allows users to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and explore various ensemble learning techniques using predefined datasets or their own data.

## Features

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
  - Select numerical features for PCA
  - Visualize PCA results with scatter plots and scree plots
  - Display explained variance and cumulative variance

- **Ensemble Learning Methods**
  - Voting Classifier and Regressor
  - Bagging Classifier and Regressor
  - Boosting Classifier and Regressor
  - Stacking Classifier and Regressor

## How to Use

1. **Select or Upload Data**
   - Choose a predefined dataset from the dropdown menu or upload your own CSV file.
2. **Select Analysis Type**
   - Choose either PCA or Ensemble Learning.
3. **PCA Analysis**
   - Select numerical features and adjust the number of PCA components.
   - View the PCA results and visualizations.
4. **Ensemble Learning**
   - Select the task type (Classification or Regression).
   - Choose the ensemble method and adjust relevant parameters.
   - View model performance and visualizations.
